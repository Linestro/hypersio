Tool **`hypersio-perf-explore`** is a Python script located in a *src/tools* directory.

# Description
The tool uses a trace generated by `hypersio-trace-gen` and launches one or several performance simulations. All simulations are performed
in parallel, making each one a separate process. `hypersio-perf-explore` is a wrapper generating a
configuration file to *build/perf_configs* directory and providing it along with other parameters to `hypersio-perf` tool.

Architectural parameters are generated by the tool, and the default configuration can be found in *lib/sioperf_config.py*.
I/O link bandwidth should be configured separately using `--linkgbps` command line option.

# Parameters
Parameters and their description can be checked by running `hypersio-perf-explore -h`. The tool has the next required arguments,
which should be same as used for `hypersio-trace-gen` while making a hyper-tenant trace:
- `--benchmark <name>` - name of a benchmark
- `--tenants <num>` - the total number of tenants which will be in the final hyper-tenant trace
- `--tenantorder <rr|rand>` - order between tenants. Currently, the tool supports **rr** and **rand**, standing for round-robin and random tenant interleaving correspondingly.
- `--tenantburstpkt <num>` - the number of consecutive packets from a single tenant 


# Examples
To run performance simulation for a default configuration for three tenants with round-robin interleaving and packet burst size of one,
run the next command:
```
hypersio-perf-explore --benchmark iperf3 --tenants 3 --tenantorder rr --tenantburstpkt 1
```
By default, I/O link bandwidth is 200Gb/s. If you want to run a simulation with 400Gb/s link run:
```
hypersio-perf-explore --benchmark iperf3 --tenants 2 --tenantorder rr --tenantburstpkt 1 --linkgbps 400
```
